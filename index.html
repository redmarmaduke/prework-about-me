      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        I was a developer for Oracle working on test software
        for their SPARC Hypervisor.  After a reduction in force at that company
        I have chosen to develop new skill sets to enhance my marketability.

      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Central Valley of California</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Computer Graphics and Gaming</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>
        My dream job is to work on software that provides a meaningful visual
        experience to people whether it's modeling financial and medical data
        or providing a modern means for artistic expression.

      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>San Jose, California</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>
        It's a practical choice for someone looking for a skill set that will
        continue to be needed for a long time to come.  The World Wide Web is
        not going anywhere.  It's also a visually oriented media which makes
        front end web development an appealing option.
